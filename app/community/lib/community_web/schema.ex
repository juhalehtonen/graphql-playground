  The GraphQL API is how weâ€™re going to expose our data to the web, so we're going
  to place the code for the schema in the web context of our application.

  Note: thanks to Absinthe we can write things like `:all_links` (idiomatic Elixir)
  even when idiomatic GraphQL would expect `allLinks` instead. The conversion is
  done for us.
